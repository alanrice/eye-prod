> Eye Prod - Gentle eye care prods while you work.

* Blink reminder through native notifications
  * Occasional reminder to blink effectively
	 * People usually blink about 18 times a minute.
	 * Often when using a computer people blink less frequently and not as fully.
  * Adjustable interval from 1 to 100 minutes
   * Add variability to make reminders less predictable
